> Particularly simple old school single page lightweight web framework for clever javascript developers.

You need to be clever to understand why this framework is that party(cular) you want to have.

But I allow you to use it anyway!

> I just want to develop with Javascript: The code I write IS the code I run in the browser.
> Writing Javascript and HTML the old way, but using latest, modern JavaScript! So I can directly run and debug my code in the browser without any special tools. Instantly!
> No modules! Really? Really! Read more about SIPA in the [docs](https://sipa-js.github.io).

> [!CAUTION]
> in development, beta state.

To get started or just to read the docs, you are welcome to visit the official Sipa documentation at https://sipa-js.github.io.
